# FINAL-PHASE-3-PROJEC-DATA-ENGINEERING-
Finalization phase: Project Data Engineering -Topic-Batch-Data-Processing


Batch Data Processing is the way of processing huge amount of the historical data, under this project author was using the historical data from secondary data sources of the kaggle.com in file of CSV

The main objective of this projects is to structure batch data processing application system in order tosolve the problem of Processing huge amount of which are produced into different area and sources and the methodology used to conduct this project are Mixed methodology it mean that under this project methodology used are both qualitative and quantitative and source of data collected under this project are secondary source of data which are found under Kaggle.com references https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams/data.


The software which are used to implement this projects are https://github.com/ndewacosmas/PHASE-ONE-SECOND-ATTEMPT-/blob/main/README.md

The concept of this projects are correspond with the results which are obtained, the result are achived according this  projects but this project it fce some challenges due the factor of how to prepare Machine learning was out of the scope of the works.but out of that the result which are obtained are correspond with the goal of the projects.


According this study Application system which are developed by the author show that this system will solve the problem of huge amount of data,under this project author was extracted data from Kaggle.com in the link of https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams/data and transforming the extracted data by the microservice of ETL, which mean that Extract Transform and load the data into another microservices of Pre and processing for verification and analysis of the data by using machine learning and the products are visualized into Dashboard as shown in the link above. under this project author show that designed and architectured work of Batch data processing is the solution of processing huge amount of the data which are produced into any source.



Conclusion, on solving of the problem of processing huge amount of data the system used to solve this problem are Batch data Processing application which are designed and architecture by the author in order to minimize errors, saving time and maintain reliability, scalability and maintainability of the system. This system which are designed it provide data protection, governance and security due the use of the database system.
